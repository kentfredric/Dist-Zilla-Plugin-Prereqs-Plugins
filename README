Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::Plugins

This is mostly because I am lazy, and the lengthy list of hand-updated
dependencies on my @Author:: bundle started to get overwhelming, and I'd
periodically miss something.

This module is kinda "AutoPrereqs"y, but in ways that I can't imagine
being plausible with a generic "AutoPrereqs" tool, at least, not without
requiring some nasty re-implementation of how "dist.ini" is parsed.
