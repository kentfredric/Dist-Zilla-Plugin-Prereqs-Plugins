NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::Plugins - Add all Dist::Zilla plugins
    presently in use as prerequisites.

VERSION
    version 1.000000

SYNOPSIS
        [Prereqs::Plugins]
        ; all plugins are now develop.requires deps

        [Prereqs::Plugins]
        phase = runtime    ; all plugins are now runtime.requires deps

DESCRIPTION
    This is mostly because I am lazy, and the lengthy list of hand-updated
    dependencies on my @Author:: bundle started to get overwhelming, and I'd
    periodically miss something.

    This module is kinda "AutoPrereqs"y, but in ways that I can't imagine
    being plausible with a generic "AutoPrereqs" tool, at least, not without
    requiring some nasty re-implementation of how "dist.ini" is parsed.

METHODS
  "mvp_multivalue_args"
    The list of attributes that can be specified multiple times

        exclude

  "get_plugin_module"
        $instance->get_plugin_module( $plugin_instance );

  "skip_prereq"
        if ( $instance->skip_prereq( $plugin_instance ) ) {

        }

  "get_prereq_for"
        my ( $module, $version ) = $instance->get_prereq_for( $plugin_instance );

  "register_prereqs"
    See "Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource"

ATTRIBUTES
  "phase"
    The target installation phase to inject into:

    *   "runtime"

  "relation"
    The type of dependency relation to create:

    *   "recommends"

    *   "suggests"

        Though think incredibly hard before using this last one ;)

LIMITATIONS
    *   This module will NOT report @Bundles as dependencies at present.

    *   This module will NOT *necessarily* include ALL dependencies, but is
        only intended to include the majority of them.

        Some plugins, such as my own "Bootstrap::lib" don't add themselves
        to the "dzil" "->plugins()" list, and as such, it will be invisible
        to this module.
