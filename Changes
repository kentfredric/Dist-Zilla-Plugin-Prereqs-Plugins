Release history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Prereqs-Plugins

 [00 MAJOR / Internals Reinvention]
 - Due to Dist::Zilla versions 5.032 and higher now ripping out :version from the payloads prior to anything being able
   to see it[1,2], the implementation details have had to be reinvented.
 - This was arguably a bad idea in the first place to use a property you had to traverse 2 seperate private methods to
   find in the first place.
 - However, the new technology is based on my bakeini stack work, and is thus partially fragile in that it inherently
   parses and processes dist.ini ( and any bundles in it ) in a way slightly different to Dist::Zilla.
 - Thus, there are 2 parses of dist.ini going on, and any bundles will now be invoked *twice* in the same process, thus
   opening for risk any kind of code that did not expect that to happen.
 - This is hopefully not the long term solution, and hopefully Config::MVP itself can be augmented to expose this data
   better without needing to resort to the second parse stack.

 [01 Minor / Increased visibility of top level :version]
 - One fringe benefit of the changes however is the increased visibility of the ":version" statement that can appear on
   its own at the top of a dist.ini declaring a minimum dzil version. This value is now consumed if present and
   communicated as a dependendy on that Dist::Zilla version.
 - Thus, this plugin is more comparable to DZP:AuthorDeps in exposing dependencies, while still superceding it in terms
   of reporting deep bundle-specific deps.

 [00 Major]
 - WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL
 - Method of action moved deeper to Dzil internals
 - can now divine the value of :version passed anywhere in dist.ini or @Bundles
 - however, due to switching to the DZil Section Sequence assembly, plugins that modify $zilla->plugins directly willl
   not be seen.
 - If you have such a plugin and you wish to fix this, perhaps look at DZ:Util::PluginLoader
