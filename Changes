Release history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Prereqs-Plugins

1.002000 2014-09-06T11:37:39Z
 [00 Major]
 - WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL
 - Method of action moved deeper to Dzil internals
 - can now divine the value of :version passed anywhere in dist.ini or @Bundles
 - however, due to switching to the DZil Section Sequence assembly, plugins that modify $zilla->plugins directly willl
   not be seen.
 - If you have such a plugin and you wish to fix this, perhaps look at DZ:Util::PluginLoader
